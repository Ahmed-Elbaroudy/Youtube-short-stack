# Extension Icons

You need to create or download the following icon files for the extension:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Place all these files in this directory.

Recommended icon design:
- Use a clock or timer symbol with YouTube colors
- Make sure the icons are recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)

Without these icons, the extension may not display properly in the Chrome toolbar or extensions page.
